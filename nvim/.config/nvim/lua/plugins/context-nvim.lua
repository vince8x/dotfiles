~ Step 3: Resource Curation
1. Identify learning materials matching [LEARNING_STYLE]:
   - Video courses
   - Books/articles
   - Interactive exercises
   - Practice projects
2. Rank resources by effectiveness
3. Create resource playlist
Output comprehensive resource list with priority order

~ Step 4: Practice Framework
1. Design exercises for each topic
2. Create real-world application scenarios
3. Develop progress checkpoints
4. Structure review intervals
Output practice plan with spaced repetition schedule

~ Step 5: Progress Tracking System
1. Define measurable progress indicators
2. Create assessment criteria
3. Design feedback loops
4. Establish milestone completion metrics
